This project implements the prediction of CPI(cycles per instruction) using different real time hardware Performance counter values collected by using PERF tool in linux.
I implemented Linear regression by considering more than 7 miss events and displayed the stats obtained.

Here several files names like 531 are corresponding to different PMC values collected by running different bench mark programs of SPEC 2017.
